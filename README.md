Like minesweeper, but you are looking FOR the treasure. There are also obstacles.

This was made for an office coding challenge, where we were to implement Minesweeper, but you WANT to find treasure.
You have a shovel with a limited number of uses, and you have to find Treasure.
The map is a square grid, determined by player selected difficulty.
The obstacles are rocks, that will damage the shovel.
In addition, digging in an empty square will slightly reduce the shovel's health.

The game will conclude when either all treasure has been found, or if your shovel breaks (loses all its health).
